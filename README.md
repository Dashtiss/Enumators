# Brandon's Emulator Collection

A collection of probably-not-cycle-accurate emulators written in various languages, because why not?

## Current Projects

### [CHIP-8](./Chip-8)
- A minimalistic CHIP-8 emulator written in Python
- Status: Somewhat functional, if you squint hard enough
- Features: White rectangles that occasionally resemble games

## Planned Projects
- NES Emulator (Coming neverâ„¢)
- Game Boy Emulator (In my dreams)
- PlayStation 5 Emulator (Just kidding)

## Project Goals
1. Learn how computers work (or don't)
2. Break things in interesting ways
3. Pretend to understand clock cycles
4. Question life choices

## Getting Started
Each emulator has its own README with specific setup instructions and a list of known issues (there are many).

## Development Philosophy
- If it works, don't touch it
- If it doesn't work, pretend it's a feature
- Comments are for the weak (just kidding, please comment your code)

## Contributing
Each project is a beautiful disaster in its own way. Feel free to make them less disastrous through pull requests.

## License
MIT License (Because I like to share my mistakes with the world)

## Words of Wisdom
